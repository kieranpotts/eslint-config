This repository encapsulates the code and configuration for an ESLint configuration that I use to enforce consistent coding styles and conventions across my JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

== Documentation

The following documentation covers the development and maintenance of this package. For API documentation and other usage instructions, see the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/kieranpotts-eslint-config[README of the published package] in the NPM registry.

=== Publishing

Publishing package updates to the NPM registry is currently a manual process. The following steps should be followed to publish a new version of the package:

1. Change to the `src` directory.

2. Manually update the version number in the `package.json` file. Review the other contents of the `src` directory. There is no build step, so the contents of the `src` directory are published as-is.

3. Follow the instructions to authenticate your NPM account.

For more guidance, see NPM's documentation on link:https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-unscoped-public-packages[creating and publishing unscoped public packages].
