Adding a trailing newline to non-empty files is a common idiom in Unix-like
systems. Benefits include the ease of appending to or concatenating files, and
outputting file contents to the terminal while ensuring the prompt line is
returned to column zero after.

For these reasons, it is RECOMMENDED to including a single newline character
at the end of every JavaScript file. This can be done automatically using tools
like EditorConfig or other text editor settings.

âš¡WARNING: The last character in this file is `/`, so ESLint should emit a
warning with the message "Newline required at end of file but not found.".

See also the rules for `no-multiple-empty-lines`, `no-trailing-spaces` and
`linebreak-style`.
